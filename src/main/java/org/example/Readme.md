# Exploring Java `String` Methods

Submitted by: Bayquen, Christopher Gilbert A. | August 7, 2025

This repository holds our lab activity exploring the different methods of the `String` literal in Java.

**Output Predictions**

- Exercise 1: the program will output `the length of the string is: 14`
- Exercise 2: the program will output the character `l` at index 5.
- Exercise 3: the program will output the substring `is`.
- Exercise 4: the upper string will be `THIS IS A TEST` and the lower string would be `this is a test`.
- Exercise 5: the `indexOfFox` would have the value `17`, `indexOfZ` would have `37`, and lastly `indexOfCat` would be `-1` since the substring `cat` could not be found.
- Exercise 6: the output of the equality demonstration between the `str1`, `str2`, and `str3`, would be `false`, `true`, `true` respectively.
- Exercise 7: the replaced string would be `I like dogs. Cats are cute.`
- Exercise 8: assuming that there are 3 spaces before and after the main string, `padded length = 20`, `trimmed string = "Lots of spaces"`, and `Trimmed string length = 14`.
